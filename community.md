openHAB is proud to be a community driven project maintained by a passionate and growing community. Since its very beginning openHAB captured the attention of home automation enthusiasts and now thousands of homes worldwide are controlled through openHAB software.

We maintain several communication channels to make it easy and effective for our users to communicate with each other and to provide support to them:

* [openHAB Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/openhab)
* [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/issues)
* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/104057398315501111932)
* [KNX Users Forum [german]](http://knx-user-forum.de/openhab/)

There are other channels, which we do not officially maintain, but where there is a good chance to find support from other users on specific topics or in specific languages:
