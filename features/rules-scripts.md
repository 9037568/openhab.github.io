## Rules

---

openHAB has a highly integrated, lightweight but yet powerful rule engine included. Rules are written in a java-like language. Rules can be triggered with different types of events, like changes of certain device status change, time or system events.

Apart from defining flexible logic openHAB rules provide a set of different actions which can be taken by the rule, like sending commands and updates to devices, sending tweets or e-mails and so on.


## Scripts

---

Scripts is a way to create reusable components for your rules. If you need to use the same code from time to time in different rules you can create a script with it and then reuse it in different parts of your logic.
