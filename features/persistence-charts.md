## Persistence

---

The persistence support allows storing devices states over time - so called time series. openHAB is not restricted to a single data store. Different stores can co-exist and configured independently.

When persisting states, there are many different possibilities one might think of: relational databases, NoSQL databases, round-robin databases, Internet-of-Things (IoT) cloud services, simple log files etc. openHAB tries to make all of these options possible and configurable in the same way. Note that some options might only be good for exporting data (e.g. IoT services or log files), while others can be easily queried as well and hence be used for providing historical data for openHAB functionality.
